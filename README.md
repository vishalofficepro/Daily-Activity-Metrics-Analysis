# Data Analysis & Visualization of Daily Activity Metrics
This project performs data analysis and visualization of daily activity metrics, using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The dataset includes activity-related features like total steps, calories burned, and active minutes.

## Instructions:
- Clone the repository.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`daily_activity_analysis.ipynb`).
- Ensure all dependencies (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`) are installed.
- Run the notebook and follow the analysis.

## Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization (Histograms, Scatter plots, Heatmaps)
- Feature Engineering
- Simple Linear Regression (Steps vs Calories)
